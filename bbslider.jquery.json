"description": "Bare Bones Slider is a jQuery slider that is very flexible. The biggest strength of this slider isn't what it does; it's what it doesn't do. By default, there's very little code and functionality so developers can implement their own functions to control it with public methods. It also features on-demand image loading, touch controls, retrievable variables and callbacks.",
